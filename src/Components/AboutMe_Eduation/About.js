                    <p>I graduated from and was certified by <a href="https://devmountain.com" target="_blank" >DevMountain</a> in April of 2019 as a full-stack developer.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the blessing of family, I have had the opportunity to work closely with different marketing agencies and their clients which started my road to specializing in e-commerce development.</p>
                    <p>I've been a techy my whole life. I love the details, advancements, and capabilities of technology. I always knew that I wanted to be a part of it. My brothers pursued careers in Marketing which significantly influenced my decision to pursue web development.</p>
                    <p>I'm also a big film junkie, and I love a good story. That's part of why I love UI development and working with marketing teams to help tell a company's story. </p>
